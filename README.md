# Hotel Booking System with Django

## Introduction

Welcome to my fourth milestone project. In this project, I create a hotel booking system where users can register an account, book a room, and manage their bookings.  
It will use the Django framework, Python, HTML, and JavaScript languages.

This project aims to show the use of CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete). After registering an account, the user can create, read, update and delete their hotel booking.

A live website can be found [here](https://my-hotel-project.herokuapp.com/).
